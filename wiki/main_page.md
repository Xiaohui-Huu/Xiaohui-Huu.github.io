# About me
Iâ€™m a master student in Security PRIDE Research Group at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), advised by [Prof. Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/index.html) and co-supervised by [Dr. Ningyu He](https://ningyu-he.notion.site/Ningyu-s-Homepage-74990eabecda4c5b9cd0e90762ebc7a9). I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2023. 
My research interests center on *blockchain security* and *DeFi*. My broader interests include uncovering software bugs to assess exploitability, analyzing DeFi activities to pretend misbehaviors (e.g., exploits, scams, and MEV).

:rocket: **I am actively exploring a PhD opportunity to contribute to impactful research.**
